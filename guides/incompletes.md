## Incompletes

Incomplete grades allow you to complete coursework after the semester if you were unable to finish them due to extenuating circumstances. You will have an Incomplete (I) grade for the semester and receive extended completion deadlines to submit the incomplete assignments. After resolving the incomplete, your letter grade will be calculated and submitted. If you're interested in taking an incomplete, please first read through the registrar's website [here](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/faculty-staff/grading/incomplete-grades/).

A couple important requirements from the website:

- "Students who fail to turn in all required work cannot request an I grade unless they have been unable to finish because of circumstances beyond their control."
- Your work must be of "passing quality", meaning that completing the projects you're taking an incomplete for would bring you to at least a passing grade in the course. The grade bins can be found in [the syllabus](/su24/about#grading).

In CS61B, you may receive an incomplete on at most **2 projects** or **1 project/1 exam**.

## Incomplete deadlines

- By default, the deadline to turn in incomplete assignments will be Sunday, August 25th (8/25). We will not be granting further extensions aside from exceptional cases.
- If you are taking an incomplete on the final, you will take the Fall 2024 final exam. 

## Is an incomplete right for you?

As you're deciding whether to take an incomplete, we highly recommend talking to an academic advisor. Here are some links you may be able to use to set up an appointment:

- [Data Science Advising](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/advising-counseling/ess-advising/)
- [College of Engineering Advising](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/advising-counseling/ess-advising/)
- [L&S CS Advising](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/advising)

An incomplete grants you additional time on assignments that you may not have been able to complete during the semester due to extenuating circumstances. However, there are drawbacks as well.

- You'll be working on the assignments during break, so you should expect to complete the assignments without official staff support.
- Especially if you're taking an incomplete on the final, you'll be completing the incomplete work in parallel with your usual coursework.

## Requesting an incomplete

To request an incomplete, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/SjDEJH6rrQ8fYqSs9) by **Sunday, August 11th (8/11) at 11:59pm**. We will be processing incomplete requests on a rolling basis.

If you do not meet one of the requirements above, we will still review your request on a case-by-case basis.

## FAQ

**Q: How does the clobber work if I take an incomplete on the final?**

A: We will calculate your percentile based on scores from next semester's final (e.g. if you take the Fall 2024 final, your percentile is calculated relative to the Fall 2024 scores). That percentile will be used when clobbering your midterm scores from the current semester.

**Q: If I take an incomplete on Project 3, will I get a partner?**

A: We may be able to find you a partner in some cases, but you should expect to work alone.

**Q: How would I submit assignments that I take an incomplete on?**

A: You should submit incomplete assignments the same way you submit assignments during the semester. Most of these will be autograded through Gradescope, but some assignments like Project 3 may require you to fill out other forms. We will schedule Project 3 checkoffs when we return next semester.
