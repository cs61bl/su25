## Incompletes

Incomplete grades allow you to complete coursework after the semester if you were unable to finish them due to extenuating circumstances. You will have an Incomplete (I) grade for the semester and receive extended completion deadlines to submit the incomplete assignments. After resolving the incomplete, your letter grade will be calculated and submitted. If you're interested in taking an incomplete, please first read through the registrar's website [here](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/faculty-staff/grading/incomplete-grades/).

Note on cal central grades

A couple important requirements from the website:

- "Students who fail to turn in all required work cannot request an I grade unless they have been unable to finish because of circumstances beyond their control."
- Your work must be of "passing quality", meaning that completing the projects you're taking an incomplete for would bring you to at least a passing grade in the course. The grade bins can be found in [the syllabus](/su24/about#grading).

In CS61B, you may receive an incomplete on at most **2 projects** or **1 project/1 exam**. If you received an incomplete on projects, you will be completing and submitting the project assignment from this summer not the one from the incomplete resolution semester. 

## Incomplete deadlines

- By default, the deadline to turn in incomplete assignments will be **Monday, Sepetember 30th (9/30), 2024.** Please note that **this deadline is an earlier date than the official deadline established by the university.** Therefore, please ignore any due dates/lapse dates you see on CalCentral. We will assign grades according to the schedule above. We will not be granting further extensions aside from exceptional cases. 
- If you are taking an incomplete on the final, you will take the Fall 2024 final exam. 

## Is an incomplete right for you?

As you're deciding whether to take an incomplete, we highly recommend talking to an academic advisor. Here are some links you may be able to use to set up an appointment:

- [Data Science Advising](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/advising-counseling/ess-advising/)
- [College of Engineering Advising](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/advising-counseling/ess-advising/)
- [L&S CS Advising](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/advising)

An incomplete grants you additional time on assignments that you may not have been able to complete during the semester due to extenuating circumstances. However, there are drawbacks as well.

- You'll be working on the assignments during break, so you should expect to complete the assignments without official staff support.
- Especially if you're taking an incomplete on the final, you'll be completing the incomplete work in parallel with your usual coursework.
- You will not be able to receive an incomplete on a project assignment if you have/had a misconduct case for the assignment.
- You will not be able to receive an incomplete on the final if you take the exam this summer. 
- As per university policy, **if you have 12 units of incomplete grade at any instance of your academic career at Berkeley, you will not be allowed to enroll in classes next semester.**

## Requesting an incomplete

## FAQ

**Q: When will my incomplete grade be resolved?**

A: We will not update your grade on Cal Central until about Feburary, 2025. 

**Q: I need to get my incomplete grade resolved and receive a letter grade earlier than the incomplete resolution time mentioned above. What should I do?**

A: Feel free to reach out to us through cs61b-incompletes@berkeley.edu to discuss more about your situation. We will try our best to resolve your incomplete grade as soon as possible given the circumstances, but **we cannot guarantee that we will be able to process everything in time.**

**Q: How does the clobber work if I take an incomplete on the final?**

A: We will calculate your percentile based on scores from next semester's final (e.g. if you take the Fall 2024 final, your percentile is calculated relative to the Fall 2024 scores). That percentile will be used when clobbering your midterm scores from the current semester.

**Q: How will my exam grade be calculated if the semester I'm resolving incomplete has a different policy ?**

A: We will calculate your grade according to the exam policies of this summer. For example, we might have a "65% mean shift" policy for exams during the semester, but that will NOT be applied to the calculation to your grade.

**Q: If I take an incomplete on Project 3, will I get a partner?**

A: We may be able to find you a partner in some cases, but you should expect to work alone.

**Q: How would I submit assignments that I take an incomplete on?**

A: You should submit incomplete assignments the same way you submit assignments during the semester. Most of these will be autograded through Gradescope, but some assignments like Project 3 may require you to fill out other forms. If you received an incomplete on project 3, **you must get checked off by the end of Fall 2024** so we can compute your grade in time and resolve it by the start of Spring 2025. 

**Q: Who should I email if I have any questions related to my incomplete after the summer session ends?**

A: cs61b-incompletes@berkeley.edu (We will also send any follow up details regarding your incomplete through this email.)
