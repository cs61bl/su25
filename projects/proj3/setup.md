## Task 1: Setup

{: .danger}
> The setup for this project is different from all other assignments so far. **Read this carefully and do not skip any steps!**

1. [Join the SU25 GitHub Classroom for Project 3 here](https://classroom.github.com/a/DcyBFCe2). You should see a page that looks like this:
    ![GitHub Classroom page](../assets/proj3-setup/0-github-classroom-team.png)

2. **DO NOT JOIN OR CREATE A TEAM YET!**
3. If you are working alone, click "Or... Create a new team" and enter your desired team name.

4. If you are working with a partner and they have already created a team, click "Join" on your partner's team name. **DO NOT JOIN A TEAM THAT ISN'T YOUR PARTNER'S!** If your partner has not yet created a team, they should do so now (see step 3). Once they have created a team, you can join it. **Only one partner needs to create a new team. The other should merely join the team.**
5. At this point, you should see a page like this:
    ![GitHub Classroom page accept team](../assets/proj3-setup/0-github-classroom-accept.png)

6. Click "Accept this assignment" and you should see a similar page to this:
    ![GitHub Classroom page with team name](../assets/proj3-setup/0-github-classroom-repo.png)
7. Click the blue highlighted repository link ("https://github.com/...") to go to your Project 3 repository. You should see a page that looks like this:
    ![GitHub group repo](../assets/proj3-setup/0-group-repo.png)

8. This repo is your group's code for Project 3, and will be **completely separate** from every other assignment in this class.
9.  In your command line terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to clone your group repo. **Do not clone this repo inside your personal `su25-s***` repo!** You should not be cloning your group repo inside your personal one. You can `cd ..` to go up one directory level from your `su25-s***` repo, after which it should be safe to clone.
10.  Clone your group repo with `git clone git@github.com:Berkeley-CS61B-Classroom/project-3-byow-<YOUR GROUP NAME HERE>.git`.
11. You now have the skeleton code locally! Both you and your partner should be able to add, commit, push to, and pull from `origin main` in this repo as you would otherwise (be careful of merge conflicts!).

<!-- old setup below
{: .danger}
> You need to accept your Github repo invite **within a week** of it being sent, or else it will expire, and you will not be able to work on the project.
> 
> If this happens to you, please make a *private Ed post* under **Question > Projects > Proj 3 > Logistics (Private)**. You should see an autogenerated template appear.

1. Go to your email and accept the Github repo invite.

    <img alt="Github repo invite email." src="../assets/proj3-setup/1-github-invite.webp">

2. Log in to Beacon, and click on the "Groups" tab. You should have a group listed here.

3. Click the "View Repository on GitHub" link.

4. Click "SSH" and copy the link that appears. It should look like this, with `***` replaced with some group number:

    `git@github.com:Berkeley-CS61B-Student/su25-proj3-g***.git`

    <img alt="Copy SSH link." src="../assets/proj3-setup/4-ssh-copy.webp">

5. Open a new terminal window in your local computer.

6. Use `cd` to navigate to your CS 61B folder. Most students have a folder called `cs61b`.

    Warning: Do not navigate to your personal `su25-s***` repo! You should not be cloning your group repo inside your personal one.

7. Type `pwd` in your terminal. This will output the current directory you are in.

    Make sure you do not see `su25-s***` in the output! If you do, go back to Step 6.

8. In your terminal, clone your repo, replacing the URL with the one you copied earlier:

    `git clone git@github.com:Berkeley-CS61B-Student/su25-proj3-g***.git`

9. Navigate into the repo you just cloned:

    `cd su25-proj3-g***`

10. Tell Github where to find the skeleton repo:

    `git remote add skeleton git@github.com:cs61bl/proj3-skeleton-su25.git`

11. Pull the skeleton code:

    `git pull skeleton main --allow-unrelated-histories`

Once you’ve completed the above steps, you should see your new group repo called `su25-proj3-g***` in your local files, and if you open this repo, you’ll see the `proj3` skeleton folder. From here, you and your partner can proceed as normal, by adding, committing, pushing, and pulling from this repo as you would otherwise. -->
