# This can be used to add extra text in the "Week" column.
# That's the left-most column that usually just has week numbers: 1, 2, 3, etc.
# Example: 61B uses this to add links to weekly surveys.

# Each entry in the week_extra array corresponds to one week box on the grid.
# If you want a week with no annotation, you must explicitly add a blank array entry.

# If your link is an external link to a different website, it should start with http://
# or https://. For example, "https://example.com" is good, "example.com" is bad.
# If your link is an internal link to another page on this website, you should write a
# relative filepath starting at the root of this repo, e.g. "/assets/images/logo.png".

# If show_extra: true, then we follow these rendering rules:
#   - If you leave both "name" and "link" blank, that week will have no extra text.
#   - If you fill in "name" only, that week will have "name" as text.
#   - If you fill in "name" and "link", that week will have "name" linking to "link".
#   - Filling in "link" only is undefined (it'll just show nothing).
# If show_extra: false, then nothing is rendered in that week's box.

# If you don't want this feature, just leave every entry of the array blank,
# and/or set show_extra: false in every entry.

# If you want more than a single name/link, you have to go modify syllabus.html.
# Ctrl+F "week_extra_element" for the place to edit.
# This is not recommended, because the "Week" column isn't really meant for long text.
