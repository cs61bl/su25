# Instructions for updating website #
#####################################

# To upload Google Slides (or other externally-linked) lecture slides
# to the website, use the "slides" field of each array entry below.

# To upload PDF lecture slides to the website, just put the PDF
# in assets/lectures using the filename convention below.
#
# The link to the slides will automatically appear once you
# put the PDF with the right filename in the right folder.
#
# Lecture slide filepaths are all formatted based on the lecture number.
# Pad lecture numbers, e.g. lecture 2 uses "02", not "2".
#
# For example, the first few lecture slides should be put at:
#   - /assets/lectures/cs101-sp25-lec01.pdf
#   - /assets/lectures/cs101-sp25-lec02.pdf
#     ...
#   - /assets/lectures/cs101-sp25-lec25.pdf
# If you'd like a different filepath or prefix (in the example, it's
# /assets/lectures/cs161-sp25-lec), change "lecture_prefix" below.

# You can use a mix of Google Slides and PDFs. The "slides" link takes priority,
# and if the link is empty, then the repo looks for a PDF instead.

# Use the "video", "recording", "quiz" links to link videos/recordings/quizzes.

# Rules for linking slides/videos/recordings/quizzes/readings:
# If your link is an external link to a different website, it should start with http://
# or https://. For example, "https://example.com" is good, "example.com" is bad.
# If your link is an internal link to another page on this website, you should write a
# relative filepath starting at the root of this repo, e.g. "/assets/images/logo.png".

# Each element in the array corresponds to one box on the website.
# This includes boxes that are blank or don't have a lecture.
# By default, each box spans 1 row (edit the default in syllabus.yml).
# To override this, use the "rowspan" attribute to resize a box.

# The website automatically numbers each element in the array.
# To skip numbering (e.g. for a "no lecture" box), add
# "nonumber: True" as an attribute.

# To add a box on a date without a lecture, or to add an extra box
# on a date with a lecture, add the date to the extra_days field
# in syllabus.yml (more documentation there). Then, to fill in your
# new box, add an element in the array where the box would appear.

# To highlight the cell in a special color, add "classes", and we have
# some pre-defined colors like "schedule-purple" and "schedule-green".
# You can add your own colors in _sass/custom/custom.scss if you want.
# Example:
# - title: "My Purple Leture"
#   slides: "https://www.google.com"
#   classes:
#     - schedule-purple

# - You should not need to change these unless you're rebuilding the website.
# - If your lecture slides are Google Slides links, ignore this.
# - If your lecture slides are PDFs in this repo, update this.
