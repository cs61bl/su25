# - Google Calendar events should all be prefixed "[CS101 SP25]" so that students
#   adding it to their calendar see "[CS101 SP25] Lecture" instead of just "Lecture".
# - But, on the website itself, students should just see "Lecture" instead of
#   "[CS101 SP25]" in front of all the calendar events, to avoid clutter.
# - Put the common prefix here so that the JS in calendar.html will remove the prefix
#   when rendering the website.
# - Note the trailing space is included here too, so that "[CS101 SP25] Lecture"
#   becomes "Lecture", not " Lecture".

# You can set up your own categories that are filtered and colored as you choose. Every
# event can only be matched to one category. The order that entries are provided in below
# is the order that categories will be applied in.
# Defaults are provided below, but each category consists of the following properties:
# - "name": What should appear on the button that filters the category. If you'd like
#   multiple colors to match to one button, use the same "name" for both categories.
# - "match": A regular expression reprsenting which event names should be matched to
#   this category
# - "lightTheme" / "darkTheme": The colors you'd like to display in light and dark mode
#   - "--event-background": The background color
#   - "--event-foreground": The foreground color
#   - "--event-border-color": The color of the border
# A note about accessibility: The default colors we provide are already vetted to make sure
# they meet contrast requirements. If you are going to add new colors, please make sure they
# are WCAG AA(A) compliant by using https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/.
#
# To use the default coloring, please title your events as follows:
# - OH: Include "Office Hours" in the name
# - Lecture: Include "Lecture" in the name
# - Discussion: Include "Discussion" in the name
#   - If you have special discussion names, we've also created different coloring for
#     - Bridge
#     - Exam Prep
# - Project Party: Include "Project" and "Party" in the name (for instance, "Project 1 Party" works)
# - Exam: Include "Exam", "Quest", "Midterm", "MT", or "Final" in the name
# - Review Session: Include "Review Session" in the name
