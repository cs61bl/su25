# Where should we start automatically numbering each column?

# assignment you create is numbered HW0. If you set it to 1, then that same
# assignment is numbered HW1 instead.

# This probably corresponds to how many rows you have per week, assuming
# you hold discussion once per week. For example, if you have Tu/Th classes
# (two rows per week), then your discussion boxes are probably going to
# take up two rows most of the time, so you'd set default_discussion_rowspan='2'.
# If you have M/W/F classes, though, this might be '3' instead.
default_discussion_rowspan: '3'
# Similar reasoning to discussion, assuming your homeworks/labs are weekly.
default_homework_rowspan: '1'
default_lab_rowspan: '3'
# Project rowspans are too variable, so we just set the default to 1 and
# never use the default (always manually specifying the rowspan).

# Do you want cells to automatically alternate colors each week?
# Usually the answer is yes/true if the cell appears with a regular fixed

# Usually the answer if no/false if cells appear irregularly, e.g. projects
# with long durations that span multiple weeks.
