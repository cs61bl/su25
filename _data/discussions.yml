# Instructions for updating website #
#####################################

# To upload discussion worksheets and solutions to the website, just
# put the files in assets/discussions using the filename format below.

# Pad discussion numbers, e.g. discussion 2 uses "02", not "2".
# For example, the files for discussion 2 should be placed at:
#   - /assets/discussions/cs101-sp25-disc02.pdf
#   - /assets/discussions/cs101-sp25-disc02-sols.pdf
#   - /assets/discussions/cs101-sp25-examprep02.pdf
#   - /assets/discussions/cs101-sp25-examprep02-sols.pdf
# If you'd like a different filepath or prefix (in the example, it's
# /assets/lectures/cs161-sp25-disc), change the filename bases below.

# To show worksheets, set "show_worksheet: true"
# To show solutions, set "show_sols: true"
# To show videos, set "show_videos: true"

# If you need to manually put something in the discussion cell
# (e.g. links to multiple worksheets for exam review weeks), there's
# an extra field that you can use. Anything you put in the extra
# field will be converted to Markdown.

# To highlight the cell in a special color, add "classes", and we have
# some pre-defined colors like "schedule-purple" and "schedule-green".

# Example showing various features:
# - title: "Discussion Title"
#   show_worksheet: true
#   show_sols: true
#   show_videos: true
#   slides: "https://www.example.com"

# - Each element in the array corresponds to one box on the website.
#   This includes boxes that are blank or don't have a discussion.
#   By default, each box spans 2 rows (edit the default in syllabus.yml).
#   To override this, use the "rowspan" attribute to resize a box.
# - The website automatically numbers each element in the array.
#   To skip numbering (e.g. for a "no discussion" box), add
#   "nonumber: True" as an attribute.
#
# - Discussion filepaths all start with the same base filepath and phrase,
#   which you can configure below, e.g. "/assets/discussion/cs101-sp25".
# - Then, we add a dash after the base phrase.
# - Then, we allow for up to 3 types of discussions, which you can
#   configure below. By default, we use "disc" and "examprep" as 2 types,
#   and leave the third type unused.
# - Then, we add a discussion number, with increasing numbers per box
#   on the syllabus. Numbering customization would be done in syllabus.html.
#
# - Worksheets show iff "show_worksheet: true" AND the filepath exists.
#   Solutions show iff "show_sols: true" AND the filepath exists.
#   Videos show iff "show_videos: true" AND video link exists in discussions.yml.
#   Slides show iff "show_slides: true" AND slide link exists in discussions.yml.
# - "classes" is an array passed to discussion.html to format the cell.
#   We predefined colors like schedule-purple, schedule-green, etc. in 
#   and you can add your own in _sass/custom/custom.scss if you want.

# Example usage of all the features:
#
# - title: "Welcome"
#   nonumber: false
#   show_worksheet: true
#   show_sols: true
#   show_videos: true
#   show_slides: true
#   regular_video: "https://youtube.com/1"
#   examprep_video: "https://youtube.com/2"
#   bridge_video: "https://youtube.com/3"
#   regular_slides: "https://slides.google.com/1"
#   examprep_slides: "https://slides.google.com/2"
#   bridge_slides: "https://slides.google.com/3"

# - Every semester, you have to change the path to reflect the latest semester.
# - The path MUST start with a leading slash, and MUST NOT have a slash at the end.
# - You should not need to change the rest of these unless you're rebuilding the website.
# - Slugs and path are used to build filenames.
# - Names are used to display on the website, e.g. "Exam Prep: Worksheet"
# - If your website builds at a different baseurl (e.g. your homepage is
#   cs161.org/sp25), the path should not include the baseurl.
#   It should still be /assets/discussions/cs161-sp25,
#   not /sp25/assets/discussions/cs161-sp25.
