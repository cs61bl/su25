- biography: Pronouns:she/her<br><br>Hi everyone! I'm a rising third-year CS + DS
    major from Seattle. When I'm not tutoring, you can probably find me playing word
    games/JRPGs, drinking ungodly amounts of caffeine, or finding new indie rock/k-pop
    to put in my 1000+ song playlist. Excited to meet y'all and feel free to reach
    out to me for anything :3
