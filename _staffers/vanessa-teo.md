Hi! I’m Vanessa, a senior from the Bay Area studying Computer Science and Environmental Economics & Policy. I love live music, snowboarding, sportfishing, adding places to my beli, and learning new languages. This is my 7th and final time (</3) teaching 61B (woo!) and I’m incredibly excited to meet everyone! :)
