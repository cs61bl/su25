Hi I'm AJ, a senior studying CS! This is my second semester teaching 61B. Cooking is pretty much my favorite thing to do. I also enjoy reading, skiing, and climbing. My favorite restaurant in Berkeley is Vik's Chaat and I like to spend my Friday nights playing games with my friends or listening to live music.
