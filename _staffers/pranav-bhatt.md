Hi, I'm Pranav! I'm a sophomore international student from the UK—no, I don’t eat beans on toast for every meal, but I won’t deny that it slaps—studying Applied Math at Berkeley. I'm passionate about quantum computing, AI, and problem-solving—whether it's in research, poker, or origami. I loved taking CS61B and am super chuffed to be able to help you guys with this awesome course. PS.. it’s called football, and no, I will never call it “soccer”
