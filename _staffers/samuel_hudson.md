Hello 61bees! My name is Samuel, but you can call me "Sam" :)
I'm a junior Data Science major, CS minor, and I couldn't be happier to be on staff this summer! I've got lots of teaching experience from my semesters with Berkeley's Computer Science Mentors program (CSM), so maybe you'll know me from there!
I love to draw, paint (gouache has been my new obsession), and write for my hobbies, and I'm always interested in new show or movie recommendations - especially if they're animated!! If you've ever watched Arcane, She Ra, Avatar the Last Airbender, know you're in good company.
I can't wait to meet you guys, I know 61b is a hard course but I fully believe in all of you guys. You can do hard things!"
