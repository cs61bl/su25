Hi! My name is Michelle, I'm currently a sophomore studying EECS from Lompoc, CA and am super excited to be an academic intern for 61B this semester! Outside of classes, I love listening to Taylor Swift and Noah Kahan, swimming, reading, journaling, and I've been getting into bouldering recently. Super excited for this semester! :)
