Hello!! I'm Ethan, a sophomore studying Computer Science from Los Angeles, CA. I like video games, taking photos on my digital camera with friends, and have a perfectly healthy obsession for collecting hirono mystery boxes! You will probably find me in Alley Kitchens getting matcha, so feel free to chat with me! Really excited for this semester!!
