yooo! what's good my 61Besties! I'm Mihir, a 4th year from Mountain View, CA. This is my 7th and final semester teaching at Berkeley. Something new I'm trying to pick up this semester is pickleball. 61B will always be my favorite course and hopefully I can share that excitement with yâ€™all. I look forward to meeting everyone and having a great semester :D
