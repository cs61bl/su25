Hi y'all! I'm a senior majoring in CS, and this will be my sixth time teaching CS 61B. When I'm not rambling about data structures, you might catch me working in Soda, working out at RSF, or catching up with lectures at various Cafes around Berkeley. Looking forward to an amazing semester with y'all!
