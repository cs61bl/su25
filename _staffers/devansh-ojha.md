Waddup! I'm Devansh, a sophomore from LA studying EECS. In my free time, I enjoy hitting the gym, playing soccer, hiking, journaling, and cooking new recipes (I love tiramisu). CS61B was one of the most fun classes I took here and I look forward to making it the same for you all! Looking forward to meeting everyone :)
