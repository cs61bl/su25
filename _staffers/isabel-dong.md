hi! i'm isabel, a sophomore intended business + data science from the bay area. i'm a huge fan of women's college basketball, snoopy, the new york times connections, and collecting smiskis. in my free time, you can find me playing basketball, listening to taylor swift, or sneaking onto tennis courts to play pickleball. excited to meet y'all :)
