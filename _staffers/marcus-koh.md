Hello! I am Marcus, sophomore studying Computer Science and Physics, and I'm excited to be a tutor for 61B this semester. Outside of academics, I enjoy skiing, Rocket League, board games, and listening to EDM. I usually spend my Friday nights gaming, sleeping, or hanging out with friends. When it comes to food, my go-to restaurant in Berkeley is Racha's Cafe.
