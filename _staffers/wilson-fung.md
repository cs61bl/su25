Hi everyone! Iâ€™m a senior studying CS with a DS minor. This is my 4th semester teaching CS61B/L as a TA, but I did Tutor for Data8 in Summer 2023. I came into Berkeley as ChemE and changed my major 7+ times before deciding on CS my sophomore spring, when I took 61B. In my free time, I love exploring new food spots, working at cafes, playing volleyball, and vlogging!
