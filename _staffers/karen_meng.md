🌊 Hi!! I’m Karen, a rising third-year EECS major from Davis. I enjoy listening to music 🎶 (mostly cpop, but feel free to rec me anything!), going on Sharetea runs 👀, doom-scrolling 💀 through Ed 🤓, and using emojis 👌 💯. I’m also trying to spend more time doing “research” on this seemingly intangible thing called grass 🧐 😬 (lmk if u have any leads lol). Looking forward to a 61BLegendary semester 😎
