Hi! I’m Ashley and I’m a fourth-year EECS major from Irvine, CA. This is my sixth time on 61B(L) staff. I like cats, public transit, shiny Pokemon, cursed data structures, and 61bees. I also enjoy making bad jokes, memorizing random facts, and exploring the Bay Area. Looking forward to meeting y’all!
