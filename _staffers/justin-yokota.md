Hi All! Iâ€™m Justin (he/him), one of the co-instructors for 61B and 61C this semester. As an undergraduate, I did a double math/CS major, and completed a fifth-year masters in a parallel computing project (all at Berkeley). I additionally worked as a TA for nine semesters, with a focus on exam writing. Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing Celeste (9D is brutal) and solving/writing puzzles as part of BMT and teammate. Part 1 of 2: Literal wariness snacks overpays, but fries alert scams. Foaming clams?
