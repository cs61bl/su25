Hello everyone! I’m Anirudh, a junior majoring in Math and CS from the Bay, and this is my fourth time as a 61B TA. In my free time, I LOVE playing video games like Smash (Kirby is the best) and Overcooked. I also really enjoy speed-solving Sudokus or KenKens and playing the NYT games. I’m super duper excited to work with you all :)
