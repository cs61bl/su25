Hi everyone, I'm Wilson and I just graduated this past May as a CS major. I'm super excited to be able to lecture for 61B(L) and in the past, I've taught CS61B/L as a TA the past 4 semesters, and was a Tutor for Data8 in Summer 2023. I came into Berkeley as ChemE and changed my major 7+ times before deciding on CS my sophomore spring, when I took 61B. In my free time, I love exploring new food spots, working at cafes, playing volleyball, and vlogging!
