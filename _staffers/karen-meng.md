Hi!! I’m Karen, a second-year EECS major from Davis and a first-time tutor for 61B! I listen to music a lotttt (mostly cpop, but feel free to rec me anything!), and I’m trying to spend more time doing “research” on this seemingly intangible thing called grass (lmk if u have any leads lol). Looking forward to a 61Brilliant semester :D
