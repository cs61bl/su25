Hello, I'm Benjamin a rising junior studying data science. This'll be my second time helping out with 61b and i'm super excited for the upcoming summer. In my free time I like to play badminton, cook, read, and listen to music. Look forward to meeting all of you and feel free to reach out about anything.
