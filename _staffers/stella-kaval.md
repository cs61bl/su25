Hi! Iâ€™m Stella, a senior CS major, and this is my fourth time on the CS61B staff. My goal this semester is to create a welcoming environment where course concepts are approachable and learning is a fun experience for everyone. Outside of class, you might find me enjoying an iced vanilla latte, capturing sunset pics on the Berkeley fire trails, or binge-watching reality TV!
