Hi! My name is Kanav, and I’m a fourth-year EECS major. My interests include software engineering, AI, and biology. In my free time, you can find me hiking the Fire Trails, watching sitcoms, or trying all the restaurants around Berkeley. I’m also a massive Taylor Swift fan (folklore and 1989 are my favorites). Looking forward to meeting all of you!
