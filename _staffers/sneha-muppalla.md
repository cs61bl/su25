Hi everyone! I'm Sneha, a freshman studying EECS+Business, and I'm excited to be part of the 61B course staff this semester! In my free time, I love playing+watching basketball, eating chocolate, reading historical fiction/mythologies, and been exploring filmmaking (a newbie)! I spend Sundays going on hikes with friends and family, and Little Gem's has been my go-to for dessert.
