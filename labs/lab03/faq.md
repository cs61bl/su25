### I am confused about the conceptual content covered in today's lab.

If you found the information presented in today's lab difficult, I would
recommend reading this tutorial on
[Java conditionals](https://javatutorial.net/java-control-flow-statements), and
the follow-up tutorials on [Java loops](https://javatutorial.net/java-loops) and
[Java Arrays](https://javatutorial.net/java-array), as well as reading the
relevant textbook chapters
([Loops and conditionals](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap1/chap12.html),
[Arrays](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap2/chap24.html)).

In general, nothing in this lab should be entirely new to
you (except maybe some Java syntax), so if you're having a lot of trouble,
please let a TA know.


### I am interested in learning more about Java documentation and syntax.

If you found the information presented in today's lab interesting, I would
recommend reading into the technical Java tutorials on
[Control Flow](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/flow.html) and
[Arrays](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html).
If you've noticed that Java Arrays have some pretty large weaknesses compared to
lists in say, Python, I would recommend reading the Java Documentation for the
[ArrayList class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/implementations/list.html)
(which we'll be talking about in a week or two).
