### When I try to push, I get the error "failed to push some refs"

If you see a hint that says "Updates were rejected because the tip of your
current branch was behind its remote counterpart", then read
[this section of the Git WTFS](../../../troubleshooting/git-wtfs/#error-failed-to-push-some-refs).
